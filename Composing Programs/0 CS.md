# What is Computer Science?
> CS is the study of 
> 1. What problems can be solved using computation
> 2. How to solve those problems
> 3. What techniques lead to effective solutions

It includes many aspects like Systems, AI, Graphics, Security, Networking, Programming, etc.

# Function
> All expressions in CS can use function call notation. 

## Defining Functions
Assignment is a simple means of abstraction: binds names to values.

> Function definition is a more powerful means of abstraction: binds names to expressions.

# Interpreter
> An interpreter is a program that reads a source code and executes it.

# Names
> Names are used to identify variables, functions, and other entities in a program.

There are ways to bind names to values.
1. from `some module` import `built-in names`
2. Give the value to a new name
3. `def`statement to create our own functions

# Environment Diagrams
> Environment Diagrams are a way for us to visualize the environment in which a program is running, inorder to keep track of what's going on within the Python.
