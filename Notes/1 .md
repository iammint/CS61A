# 1. Debug

## Long-term debugging

Sometimes we would like to leave the debugging code if we need to periodically test our file. It can get kind of annoying if every time we run our file, debugging messages pop up. One way to avoid this is to use a global `debug` variable:

```py
debug = True

def foo(n):
i = 0
while i < n:
    i += func(i)
    if debug:
        print('DEBUG: i is', i)
```
Now, whenever we want to do some debugging, we can set the global `debug` variable to `True`, and when we don't want to see any debugging input, we can turn it to `False` (such a variable is called a "flag").
